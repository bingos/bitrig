.Dt UUIDGEN 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uuidgen
.Nd generate universally unique identifiers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/uuid.h
.Ft int
.Fn uuidgen "struct uuid *store" "int count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn uuidgen
system call generates
.Fa count
time-based universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) and writes them to the
buffer pointed to by
.Fa store .
.Pp
Also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), UUIDs are composed of
128 bits arranged follows:
.Bd -literal
struct uuid {
	uint32_t	time_low;
	uint16_t	time_mid;
	uint16_t	time_hi_and_version;
	uint8_t		clock_seq_hi_and_reserved;
	uint8_t		clock_seq_low;
	uint8_t		node[UUID_NODE_LEN];
};
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width ".Va clock_seq_hi_and_reserved"
.It Va time_low
The least significant 32 bits of a 60-bit timestamp.
.It Va time_mid
The least significant 16 bits of the most significant 28 bits of the 60-bit
timestamp.
.It Va time_hi_and_version
The most significant 12 bits of the 60-bit timestamp multiplexed with a 4-bit
version number.
The version number is stored in the most significant 4 bits of the 16-bit
field.
.It Va clock_seq_hi_and_reserved
The most significant 6 bits of a 14-bit sequence number multiplexed with a
2-bit variant value.
Identifiers generated by the
.Fn uuidgen
system call have a variant value of 2.
The variant value is stored in the most significant bits of the field.
.It Va clock_seq_low
The least significant 8 bits of a 14-bit sequence number.
.It Va node
A random 6-byte IEEE 802 (MAC) multicast address.
.El
.Pp
All fields are stored in native byte order.
.Pp
If
.Fa count
is bigger than 1, the generated identifiers will be numerically
consecutive.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn uuidgen
system call can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The buffer pointed to by
.Fa store
could not be written to for at least one identifier.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa count
argument is less than 1 or larger than 2048.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uuidgen 1 ,
.Xr uuid 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The identifiers provided by the
.Fn uuidgen
system call are generated and represented in conformance with the DCE
1.1 RPC specification.
The system call itself, however, is not part of the specification.
